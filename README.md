Solutions to common interview problems listed at page [The 30-minute guide to 
rocking your next coding interview](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/coding-interviews-for-dummies-5e048933b82b) by Yangshun Tay. Thank you
Yangshun Tay for general guidelines and putting together this problem list. 

After appearing for two technical interviews where I performed terrribly I was keen on improving my ability to solve programming problems 
commonly posed. By chance, I came across this wonderful page [The 30-minute guide to 
rocking your next coding interview](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/coding-interviews-for-dummies-5e048933b82b). At this point I was 
spending a lot of time on coding sites like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com), [CodeFights](https://www.codefights.com), 
[LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com), [GeeksForGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)(NOTE:Insecure) etc. And indeed, the list from Yangshun seemed to cover problems that appear often in coding interviews. So I had a go at solving all of them, looking up solutions whenever I got stuck 

Thought it would be nice to share these solutions so they could be of some help to others.  

**How Do I Know Solutions Work?**

Many problems are available on [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com). General criteria for including a solution here is it should be an Accepted 
solution on LeetCode. I will include a README file in each directory listing out solutions that are Accepted LeetCode solutions. 

Happy learning. And again, thank you for showing interest and please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. Do let me know 
if you think a solution doesn't work. Will make it higher priority to fix those.
